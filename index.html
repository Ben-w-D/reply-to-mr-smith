		<h1>Hello,</h1>
		<h1>I would love to host a shadow tomorrow! Block 9 does happen to be an open block for me, so I can't really host someone then.</h1>
		<h1>Also, will I be hosting for lunch or not? I generally prefer not but it's okay if needed, of course.</h1>

		<h1>Theoretically, <a href="mailto:bdomine2024@kehillahstudent.org">this link</a> should let you send an email to me, although it doesn't always work.</h1>
